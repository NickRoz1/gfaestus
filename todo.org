read a GFA, take the paths

construct a linear sequence of rects/nodes to be rendered from each path;
all nodes just 1 or 2 degree to start with


once that's working, break the graph down into linear components, lay
them out in that way, and then reconnect them & apply some kind of
force to lay out the parallel parts


after that i need to handle loops, and probably a whole lot more

* stuff

- [ ] proper rendering system that maps a laid out GFA (or subset
  thereof) to vertices & colors ready to be rendered

- [ ] MVP matrix transform for scaling & translation
- [ ] GFA segments w/ length based on seq length
- [ ] extremely simple linear & greedy layout
- [ ] render GFA segments
- [ ] render links as lines between segments


- [ ] more rigorous viewport logic & management
- [ ] antialiasing


- [ ] proper layouts
